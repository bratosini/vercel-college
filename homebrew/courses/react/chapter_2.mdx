description: Rendering User Interfaces (UI)
type: Chapter

To understand how React works, we first need a basic understanding of how
browsers interpret your code to create (or render) user interfaces (UI).

When a user visits a web page, the server returns an HTML file to the browser
that may look like this:

![Two side-by-side diagrams, left showing the HTML code, and right showing the
DOM tree.](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Flight%2Flearn-html-and-
dom.png&w=3840&q=75)![Two side-by-side diagrams, left showing the HTML code,
and right showing the DOM tree.](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Flearn-
html-and-dom.png&w=3840&q=75)

The browser then reads the HTML and constructs the Document Object Model
(DOM).

### What is the DOM?

The DOM is an object representation of the HTML elements. It acts as a bridge
between your code and the user interface, and has a tree-like structure with
parent and child relationships.

ui.png&w=3840&q=75)![Two side-by-side diagrams, left showing the DOM tree, and
right showing the rendered UI.](/\_next/image?url=%2Flearn%2Fdark%2Flearn-dom-
and-ui.png&w=3840&q=75)

You can use DOM methods and JavaScript, to listen to user events and
[manipulate the
DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-
side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents) by selecting, adding, updating, and
deleting specific elements in the user interface. DOM manipulation allows you
to not only target specific elements, but also change their style and content.

In the next section you'll learn how to use JavaScript and DOM methods.
